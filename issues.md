#Issues

* Floating objects
** Look at & and && logic in decision to generate.

* Tree shapes
** Make length function of base width

* Make generation faster
** Allow non-interactables belong to same mesh to cut instanciation of MonoBehaviours drastically
** Make trees have a max continuing segments and then too balance depth vs breadth
