#Issues

* Floating objects
  

* Tree shapes
  * Make length function of base width
  * Disallow world coord too much down growth

* Make generation faster
  * Allow non-interactables belong to same mesh to cut instanciation of MonoBehaviours drastically
  * Make trees have a max continuing segments and then too balance depth vs breadth
